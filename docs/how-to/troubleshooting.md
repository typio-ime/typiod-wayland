# Troubleshooting

## `typio --list` shows no engines

Most often the plugin is installed in a directory that is not on the search
path, or the file name does not match the expected pattern. The scanner
looks for `libtypio_engine_<name>.so` (underscores). Cargo produces this
naming natively, so no rename should be needed.

Confirm the plugin sits in a scanned directory and is readable:

```bash
ls ~/.local/lib/typio/engines
ls /usr/local/lib/typio/engines
```

The [basic engine](../../typio-engine-basic) is a separate repository: build it
with `cargo build --release`, then install the `.so` into an engine directory.

See the [Engine Discovery Reference](../reference/engine-discovery.md) for the
full search-path order and naming rules.

## `Failed to connect to Wayland display`

The daemon must run inside a Wayland session.

Check:

```bash
echo "$WAYLAND_DISPLAY"
echo "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE"
```

Expected:

- `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is non-empty
- `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`

## `Session does not provide the Wayland input-method/text-input protocol stack`

Your compositor is not exposing `zwp_input_method_manager_v2`, or the session is not configured for the daemon to use it.

Quick check:

```bash
wayland-info | grep -E 'zwp_input_method_manager_v2|zwp_input_method_v2'
```

If nothing appears, the daemon cannot attach as an input method in that session.

Also verify that applications in the session have a usable `text-input-v3` path:

```bash
wayland-info | grep -E 'zwp_text_input_manager_v3|zwp_text_input_v3'
```

## `Input method unavailable - another input method may be active`

Only one input method can own the protocol seat at a time.

Stop other input method daemons in the same session before starting typio.

## Typing works poorly or there is no candidate window

That is expected with the `basic` engine. It commits printable characters directly and does not implement candidate UI or advanced composition.

For richer behavior, install an external engine plugin.

With the `rime` plugin, the daemon renders candidates through the Panel when the required Wayland input-popup objects are available. If you still only see inline candidates, the daemon likely failed to initialize `wl_compositor` or the input-popup surface itself.

If edits under `~/.local/share/typio/rime` do not affect candidate behavior, switch to the `rime` engine and run:

```bash
typio rime deploy
```

That asks the daemon to rerun librime deployment and regenerate `~/.local/share/typio/rime/build/*.yaml` from your source YAML files.

If the Panel looks blurry on a 2x HiDPI output, make sure you are running a recent build. The Panel now follows `wl_surface.enter/leave` and `wl_output.scale`, so integer output scales should render sharply after a restart of the daemon.

If the Panel theme does not match your desktop, set one explicitly in `~/.config/typio/wayland.toml`:

```toml
[display]
panel_theme = "dark"
candidate_layout = "horizontal"
```

If the tray shows a generic icon instead of the Rime icon, make sure you are running a rebuilt binary and that the installed icon theme path is readable. The daemon now prefers the installed `hicolor` theme directory over the source-tree icon directory when exporting `IconThemePath`, and still provides an `IconPixmap` fallback for tray hosts that do not resolve themed icons consistently.

## Candidate Navigation Becomes Sluggish After Extended Runtime

**Symptom:** Normal typing remains smooth, but scrolling through the candidate list with arrow keys or page keys becomes visibly delayed or appears to skip frames. The problem only appears after the daemon has been running for several hours and worsens over time.

**Root cause (fixed in current builds):** Each time a Wayland keymap event was received from the compositor, the daemon duplicated the file descriptor and sent the copy to the virtual keyboard, but never closed the duplicate. Every application focus switch leaks one file descriptor. The Linux per-process fd limit is 1024 by default; as the table fills up, calls that need a new fd (such as `mkstemp` inside the SHM buffer allocator) start failing. Failed buffer allocation causes candidate Panel frames to be silently dropped during navigation.

**Diagnosis:** While the daemon is running, count the leaked entries:

```bash
ls -la /proc/$(pidof typio)/fd | grep '/run/user/.*deleted' | wc -l
```

A healthy process shows zero or a very small number. Hundreds of entries confirm the leak.

**Fix:** Restart the daemon to clear the accumulated file descriptors immediately:

```bash
pkill -TERM typio
typio &
```

The underlying leak is patched in the current source. Rebuilding and reinstalling eliminates it permanently.

## Debug Logging

```bash
typio --verbose
```

Logs go to stderr. To keep a trace:

```bash
typio --verbose 2>&1 | tee typio-trace.log
```

Keyboard trace lines include both raw key data and the resolved text character when XKB can derive one, for example `unicode=U+0061 char='a'`. They also carry `seq=...`, `phase=...`, and `topic=...` so related events can be correlated in order.

## Wayland Runtime Diagnostics

Current builds expose two complementary diagnostics surfaces:

- continuous logs through stderr (visible in the terminal when running manually with `--verbose`, or in the compositor's log stream when started via desktop autostart)
- a structured D-Bus `RuntimeState` property on `org.typio.InputMethod1`

Use both. Logs show the event history; `RuntimeState` shows the current frontend health snapshot.

Read the last fault snapshot from the recent-log dump:

```bash
find ~/.local/state/typio/logs -type f -name '*.log' 2>/dev/null
rg -n "Virtual keyboard|fail-safe|keymap timeout|Keyboard grab|Wayland text UI slow|Panel slow render|Rime sync slow" ~/.local/state/typio/logs/latest.log
```

Current builds keep a single persisted recent-log snapshot at `~/.local/state/typio/logs/latest.log`, replacing that file each time a new dump is written.

Read the live Wayland runtime state:

```bash
gdbus call --session \
  --dest org.typio.InputMethod1 \
  --object-path /org/typio/InputMethod1 \
  --method org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get \
  org.typio.InputMethod1 RuntimeState
```

Watch runtime-state transitions live:

```bash
gdbus monitor --session \
  --dest org.typio.InputMethod1 \
  --object-path /org/typio/InputMethod1
```

The most useful `RuntimeState` fields for troubleshooting are:

- `lifecycle_phase`: should normally settle at `active` while typing
- `keyboard_grab_active`: whether the daemon still owns the Wayland keyboard grab
- `virtual_keyboard_state`: `ready`, `needs_keymap`, `broken`, or `absent`
- `virtual_keyboard_has_keymap`: whether a compositor keymap has reached the virtual keyboard path
- `active_key_generation`: the current keyboard-grab generation
- `virtual_keyboard_keymap_generation`: which generation most recently reached the virtual keyboard keymap path
- `virtual_keyboard_drop_count`: how many forwarded events were dropped because vk was not ready
- `virtual_keyboard_state_age_ms`: how long the current vk state has been held
- `virtual_keyboard_keymap_age_ms`: how long since the last successful keymap
- `virtual_keyboard_forward_age_ms`: how long since the last successful vk forward
- `virtual_keyboard_keymap_deadline_remaining_ms`: remaining time before the daemon treats a missing keymap as a fail-safe condition
- `watchdog_armed`: whether the frontend watchdog is currently protecting an active keyboard-grab path

Interpret the most common bad combinations like this:

- `keyboard_grab_active=true` and `virtual_keyboard_state=needs_keymap` for too long: grab rebuild happened, but the compositor-to-vk keymap chain did not finish cleanly
- `virtual_keyboard_state=broken`: vk has been declared unusable and the daemon should fail open instead of continuing to swallow keys
- increasing `virtual_keyboard_drop_count`: the daemon is receiving input it cannot safely forward to the focused client

For the complete diagnostic meaning of these fields and the underlying timing model, see [Developer Timing Model](../explanation/timing-model.md).

If you report a timing or freeze problem, include both:

- the relevant `--verbose` log window
- a `RuntimeState` snapshot taken while the fault is happening

## When Input and Tray Both Stop Responding

If the daemon still starts but later all routed input stops working and the tray menu also stops responding, reproduce the failure with `--verbose` logging enabled, then keep:

- `/tmp/typio-freeze.log`
- whether `Ctrl+Shift+Escape` still exits the daemon
- compositor name and version
- the last `poll error`, `dispatch failure`, `grab`, `key`, and `im` lines

## Emergency Recovery

The keyboard shortcut emergency exit is an in-band shortcut. It depends on the same keyboard event path that may already be degraded during a severe Wayland failure. Treat it as a convenience, not as the only recovery path.

Preferred out-of-band recovery paths:

```bash
gdbus call --session \
  --dest org.typio.InputMethod1 \
  --object-path /org/typio/InputMethod1 \
  --method org.typio.InputMethod1.Stop
```

```bash
pkill -TERM typio
```

If the daemon is holding the keyboard grab but cannot safely forward keys, current builds are designed to fail open: they release the grab and stop instead of continuing to swallow input.

## Validate the Binary

```bash
ldd /usr/local/bin/typio
```

## Useful Report Data

When reporting a problem, include:

- `typio --version`
- `typio --list`
- full `--verbose` output
- compositor name and version
- whether another input method was already running
