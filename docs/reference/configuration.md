# Configuration Reference

Typio uses two files under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/typio` (default `~/.config/typio`):

| File | Owner | What it controls |
|------|-------|------------------|
| `core.toml` | **libtypio** (framework) | Engine registry, shortcuts, notifications, voice runtime, per-engine settings |
| `platform.toml` | **typio-linux** (this host) | Panel styling: theme, fonts, colours, layout |

Both files are read from the same directory.  The directory itself is created
and managed by libtypio (`typio_instance_get_config_dir`).  If you need a
custom path, use the `-c` / `--config` command-line flag.

## Quick start

1. Copy the examples:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/typio
   cp data/core.toml.example ~/.config/typio/core.toml
   cp data/platform.toml.example ~/.config/typio/platform.toml
   ```
2. Edit the keys you need.
3. Most changes are picked up **without restart** via inotify reload (see
   [Reload behaviour](#reload-behaviour) below).

## `core.toml`

### `[keyboard]` — framework policy

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `per_app_preferences` | bool | `true` | Remember and restore the keyboard engine and engine mode per application. |

### `[languages]` — language-first switching

Parsed by libtypio (ADR-0018 / [ADR-0031](../adr/0031-language-first-switching-surface.md)).
The **language** (a BCP-47 tag) is the user-facing switch unit: activating a
language retargets the keyboard and voice engine slots together.

#### Language tag format — BCP 47 (normative)

All language tags in this project — `[languages].enabled`, the `[languages.<tag>]`
table names, the engine-manifest `language` / `languages` keys, the `language.*`
IPC verbs, and engine-declared languages — **follow [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47)**.
This is the single standard contributors should reference; do not invent ad-hoc
codes.

BCP 47 is defined by two IETF RFCs, with subtag *values* drawn from the IANA
registry and underlying ISO standards:

| Reference | Role |
|-----------|------|
| [RFC 5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646) | Tag *syntax* (how subtags compose) |
| [RFC 4647](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4647) | Tag *matching* and fallback |
| [IANA Language Subtag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/) | Authoritative list of valid subtags |
| ISO 639-1/-2/-3, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1 | Source standards for language, script, and region subtags |

A tag is subtags joined by hyphens, `language[-script][-region]`:

| Example | Decoded | Subtag standards |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `en` | English | ISO 639-1 |
| `zh-Hans` | Chinese, Simplified Han script | ISO 639-1 + ISO 15924 |
| `ary` | Moroccan Darija (no two-letter code exists) | ISO 639-3 |
| `ar-MA` | Arabic as localized to Morocco | ISO 639-1 + ISO 3166-1 |

Guidance:

- Use **`ary`** for the Moroccan Darija vernacular. `ar-MA` is *Arabic localized
  to Morocco* (typically Modern Standard Arabic) — a different language.
- Prefer a **script** subtag (`zh-Hans` / `zh-Hant`) over a region subtag
  (`zh-CN` / `zh-TW`) when the distinction you mean is the writing system.
- The host treats tags as opaque and passes them to libtypio, which owns
  resolution and matching (RFC 4647). The only host-side interpretation is the
  tray/indicator endonym lookup, which keys on the **primary subtag** — so any
  `-script` / `-region` suffix still resolves to a display name.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | array (or comma-separated string) | every engine-declared language | Ordered cycle for the `switch_language` chord. May include tags no engine declares (layout-only languages). |

Per-language engine selection lives in `[languages.<tag>]` tables:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `keyboard` | string | first keyboard engine declaring `<tag>` | Keyboard engine for the language. `"none"` forces an empty slot: keys pass through raw with the system layout (layout-only languages such as Moroccan Darija). |
| `voice` | string | first voice engine declaring `<tag>` | Voice engine for the language. `"none"` forces an empty slot. |
| `icon` | string | *(language badge / generic)* | Freedesktop icon name for the tray/indicator when this language is active. Overrides the generic icon; outranked by an engine-supplied icon. Most useful for layout-only languages, which have no engine icon. |

```toml
[languages]
enabled = ["zh-Hans", "en", "ary"]

[languages.zh-Hans]
keyboard = "rime"
voice    = "whisper"

[languages.ary]
keyboard = "none"     # Moroccan Darija — layout-only: raw passthrough
```

At startup the daemon restores the persisted active language; the legacy
`keyboard.engine` / `voice.engine` chain below applies only when no languages
are enabled or declared.

#### Tray icon and the language badge (ADR-0032)

The tray icon is resolved by a precedence chain, most-specific first: the active
engine's mode/schema icon → the engine manifest `icon` → `[languages.<tag>].icon`
→ a **language text badge** → a generic glyph. The badge is a 1–3 glyph label
rendered in the language's own script (中 / あ / الد / EN), so the icon reflects
the active language even for layout-only languages with no engine (e.g. Darija).
Set `[languages.<tag>].icon` to override the badge with a themed icon. A voice
engine, when active, shows as a microphone overlay on the icon's corner; *which*
voice/keyboard engine is selected is shown in the tray menu and tooltip, not the
icon. The badge needs FreeType/HarfBuzz/Fontconfig (present in the standard
build); without them the icon falls back to the generic glyph name.

### `[shortcuts]` — global shortcuts

Parsed by libtypio.  All values are shortcut strings such as `Ctrl+Shift` or
`Super+v`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `switch_language` | `Ctrl+Shift` | Cycle the enabled language list (falls back to keyboard-engine cycling when no languages exist). |
| `switch_keyboard_engine` | *(unbound)* | Cycle to the next keyboard engine. |
| `exit` | `Ctrl+Shift+Escape` | Emergency shutdown of the daemon. |
| `voice_ptt` | `Super+v` | Push-to-talk for voice input. |

### `[notifications]` — desktop notification policy

**Consumed by typio-linux.**  These keys control startup health notifications
and runtime toast behaviour.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable` | bool | `true` | Master switch for all notifications. |
| `startup_checks` | bool | `true` | Show a notification on startup if no engine is active or the registry is broken. |
| `runtime` | bool | `true` | Allow runtime notifications (e.g. engine errors). |
| `voice` | bool | `true` | Allow voice-specific notifications (recording started / stopped / error). |
| `cooldown_ms` | int | *(backend default)* | Minimum milliseconds between two notifications. |

### `[engines.basic]` — basic engine routing

**Consumed by typio-linux** (input router).  These keys change how the
Wayland frontend routes printable keys when the basic engine is active.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `printable_key_mode` | string | `"forward"` | `"forward"` sends printable keys through virtual-keyboard forwarding; `"commit"` lets the basic engine commit them directly. |
| `compose` | bool | `false` | Enable compose sequences (`' + a → á`, `` ` + e → è ``, etc.).  When enabled, printable keys are always routed to the engine so dead-key composition works. |

### `[engines.rime]`, `[engines.mozc]`, etc. — engine-owned sections

Each engine package registers its own `engines.<name>.*` schema.  The host does
not interpret these keys; it passes the config table to the engine via the
engine ABI.

Engines obtain their data directory via `typio_instance_get_engine_data_dir()`
(returns `<data_dir>/<engine_name>/`, e.g. `~/.local/share/typio/rime/`), so
users do not need to configure `user_data_dir` manually. Only system-level
paths (like Rime's `shared_data_dir`) remain as config keys.

Common keys you may see in examples:

```toml
[engines.rime]
shared_data_dir = "/usr/share/rime-data"
full_check      = false

[engines.mozc]
server_path = "/usr/lib/mozc/mozc_server"
```

For authoritative schema and defaults, consult the individual engine repository.

### Engine selection (keyboard and voice)

These keys are the legacy per-modality chain; they apply only when no
languages are enabled or declared (see `[languages]` above). Both keyboard
and voice engines follow the same activation priority:

1. **Config override** — `keyboard.engine` / `voice.engine` in `core.toml`
2. **State persistence** — last-used engine resumed from `engine-state.toml`
3. **Auto-detection** — first registered engine of the matching type

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `keyboard.engine` | string | Override keyboard engine to activate on startup (e.g. `"rime"`, `"basic"`). When omitted, the last-used engine is resumed. |
| `voice.engine` | string | Override voice engine to activate on startup (e.g. `"whisper"`, `"sherpa-onnx"`). When omitted or the named engine is not installed, the first available voice engine is auto-selected. |

### Disabling engines

Installed engines can be excluded from loading entirely.  Disabled engines
are not started and never appear in the engine list.  Useful when you
have many engines installed but only want a subset active.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `keyboard.disabled` | string | Comma-separated keyboard engine names to skip (e.g. `"rime, mozc"`). |
| `voice.disabled` | string | Comma-separated voice engine names to skip (e.g. `"whisper"`). |

Per-engine voice settings (illustrative):

```toml
[engines.whisper]
language = "zh"
model    = "base"      # ggml model name; place at ~/.local/share/typio/whisper/ggml-<model>.bin

[engines.sherpa-onnx]
language = "auto"
model    = "sensevoice-small"   # directory name under ~/.local/share/typio/sherpa-onnx/
```

## `platform.toml`

### `[display]`

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `panel_theme` | string | `"auto"` | `"auto"` (follow desktop), `"light"`, or `"dark"`. |
| `candidate_layout` | string | `"horizontal"` | `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"`. |
| `font_size` | int | `11` | Panel text size in points (6–72). |
| `font_family` | string | `"Sans"` | Font family name.  Use a name known to Fontconfig. |
| `panel_mode_indicator` | bool | `false` | Show the engine mode label (e.g. "中" / "A") inside the Panel. |
| `anchor_probe` | bool | `true` | Send one no-op input-method commit per activation when positioned status UI is waiting for a cursor anchor. |
| `anchor_probe_timeout_ms` | int | `150` | Milliseconds to wait for anchor readiness before dropping pending positioned status UI (50–1000). |

### `[display.colors.light]` and `[display.colors.dark]`

Custom colour overrides.  Hex strings: 6-digit (`#rrggbb`) or 8-digit
(`#rrggbbaa`) with alpha.  Omit a key to keep the built-in default for that
channel.

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `background` | Panel background (RGBA) |
| `border` | Panel border (RGBA) |
| `text` | Candidate text colour |
| `muted` | Candidate index labels and mode indicator |
| `preedit` | Preedit text colour |
| `selection` | Selected-row highlight (RGBA) |
| `selection_text` | Text colour on the selected row |

## Reload behaviour

| File | Hot-reload | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| `platform.toml` | ✅ Yes | The Wayland frontend watches the config directory via inotify.  A `CLOSE_WRITE`, `MOVED_TO`, or attribute change **to `core.toml` or `platform.toml`** triggers a debounced reload (100 ms); editor swap/backup files and other directory churn are ignored. |
| `core.toml` | ✅ Yes | libtypio reloads the file on the same inotify event.  The frontend then re-queries shortcuts, voice engine, and notification settings. |

Keys that **require a restart** to take effect:

- `engines.*` schema changes (engine workers read their config at load time)
