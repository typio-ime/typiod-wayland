# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs are append-only records of significant design decisions in `typio-linux` — the Wayland host (`typiod`) for the Typio input method. Once accepted, they are not edited; a new ADR supersedes an old one if a decision changes.

Decisions about the framework core (engine ABI, composition contract) live in the `libtypio` repository's ADR set.

> **Candidate-popup lag — reading guide for ADR-0006 / 0010–0013.** The popup's
> candidate-switch lag was diagnosed in four passes, and the first three each
> *mis-attributed* the root cause. The actual cause was a **per-page swapchain
> rebuild** (ADR-0013). The earlier ADRs remain valid as **independent**
> improvements — non-blocking present (0010), colour-independent coverage glyphs
> (0011), shared glyph atlas (0012) — each fixes a real problem and is still in
> force; only their "this is what cured the lag" claim was wrong, and each now
> carries a scope-correction block. The misdiagnosis trail is kept deliberately:
> it is the record that stops the next reader repeating it.
> Later retry-latch and scheduler regressions in ADR-0015's deferral path are
> recorded in ADR-0022 and ADR-0023. Do not implement new scheduling from the
> historical `panel_update_pending` or retry-latch descriptions in ADR-0015 /
> ADR-0022; the active model is ADR-0023's `IDLE` / `DIRTY` / `RETRY`
> scheduler.
