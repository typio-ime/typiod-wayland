# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs are append-only records of significant design decisions in `typio-wayland` — the Wayland host (`typiod`) for the Typio input method. Once accepted, they are not edited; a new ADR supersedes an old one if a decision changes.

Decisions about the framework core (engine ABI, composition contract) live in the `libtypio` repository's ADR set.

> **Candidate-popup lag — reading guide for ADR-0006 / 0010–0013.** The popup's
> candidate-switch lag was diagnosed in four passes, and the first three each
> *mis-attributed* the root cause. The actual cause was a **per-page swapchain
> rebuild** (ADR-0013). The earlier ADRs remain valid as **independent**
> improvements — non-blocking present (0010), colour-independent coverage glyphs
> (0011), shared glyph atlas (0012) — each fixes a real problem and is still in
> force; only their "this is what cured the lag" claim was wrong, and each now
> carries a scope-correction block. The misdiagnosis trail is kept deliberately:
> it is the record that stops the next reader repeating it. See
> [`docs/dev/maintenance.md`](../dev/maintenance.md) for the condensed lesson.
