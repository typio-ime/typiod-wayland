# Vulkan and Flux Rendering

This document describes how typio-linux renders its Panel UI through
[flux](../../flux), a C23 Vulkan-first canvas library, and the performance
optimizations that keep an IME popup responsive under sustained input.

The pipeline stages and the backend-independence argument are covered in
[Frontend Graphics](frontend-graphics.md). This document focuses on the
**rendering technology itself** — what flux provides, how the host uses it,
and the specific optimizations that prevent stuttering.

## Flux — Vulkan Canvas Library

[flux](../../flux) is a self-contained C23 graphics library that wraps Vulkan
1.3 into a small immediate-mode 2-D canvas API. typio-linux consumes it as a
meson subproject and links it statically. The host never calls Vulkan directly.

Core flux concepts used by the host:

| Concept | flux type | Role |
|---------|-----------|------|
| GPU context | `flux_device` | Process-wide shared device; created once at startup |
| Window target | `flux_surface` | Swapchain bound to the input-popup `wl_surface` |
| Frame lifecycle | `flux_surface_begin_frame` → `flux_frame_present` | Acquire, record, submit, present |
| Recording target | `flux_canvas` | Immediate-mode: clear, fill rect, blit coverage |
| GPU image | `flux_image` | Refcounted texture; atlas is one `flux_image` |

Frame lifecycle in `surface.c`:

```c
flux_surface_begin_frame(surface, &(flux_frame_begin_desc){ .timeout_ns = ... }, &frame);
flux_canvas_begin(canvas, frame, &clear_color);
panel_record(panel, canvas, geometry);   /* pure recorder */
flux_canvas_end(canvas);
flux_frame_submit(frame);
flux_frame_present(frame);
```

The host's drawing reduces to three primitives: **clear**, **fill rect**,
**tinted coverage blit**. Nothing in the panel requires paths, custom shaders,
blend exotica, or retained scene graphs.

## Text Rendering

### Shaping stack

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Fontconfig | Font discovery (`FcFontMatch`, `FcFontSort`) |
| HarfBuzz | Text shaping (cluster → glyph mapping) |
| FreeType | Glyph rasterisation (outline → R8 coverage bitmap) |

The primary font is resolved from `display.font_family` (default `"Sans"`). When
a glyph resolves to `.notdef` (glyph ID 0), the shaper performs **per-glyph
fallback** via `FcFontSort` + `FT_Get_Char_Index` verification, trying up to
four fallback fonts per text run
([ADR-0016](../adr/0016-per-glyph-font-fallback.md)).

### Colour-independent coverage

Glyphs are rasterised into **R8 coverage** textures — single-channel alpha masks
that carry no colour information. Colour is applied at draw time as a
premultiplied `flux_color` tint via
`flux_canvas_draw_image_coverage(_sub)`:

```c
flux_canvas_draw_image_coverage_sub(canvas, atlas, dst_rect, src_uv, tint);
```

One glyph serves every colour variant (normal, muted, selection highlight,
preedit). Selecting a candidate row only adds a highlight rectangle and changes
the tint — zero GPU upload work
([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-colour-independent-coverage-glyphs.md)).

### Shared glyph atlas

All glyphs share one persistent 2048×2048 R8 atlas texture (~4 MiB GPU memory),
keyed `(font_id, glyph_id)` in an open-addressed hash table. A skyline shelf
allocator packs new glyphs into sub-rectangles
([ADR-0012](../adr/0012-glyph-atlas-shared-texture.md)).

**Why this matters for responsiveness:** before the atlas, each text run
rasterised into its own texture and uploaded it synchronously
(`vkWaitForFences` on the IME event loop). RIME candidate navigation pages the
list on every keypress, so every page triggered ~20 blocking fence waits. With
the atlas, a warmed session uploads **nothing** — CJK glyphs are shared across
every candidate and page.

### LRU layout cache

`panel_geometry_compute()` is a pure function from content + config to
`PanelGeometry`. Results are memoised in an LRU cache (capacity 128) keyed by
text + font. Paging through candidates does not re-shape text already seen.

### Atlas reclamation

Over long CJK sessions two resources accumulate dead weight: the lookup hash
table lengthens its linear-probe chains as LRU-evicted layouts leave entries
behind, and — the binding constraint — the **texture** saturates, because the
shelf packer only ever advances. At a 16 px default the 2048² image holds
~9–10 K glyphs (~3–4 K on a HiDPI output), so a daily CJK session fills it well
before the hash table reaches its 75 % threshold (98 304 of 131 072 slots).

`glyph_atlas_reclaim()` handles both with one wholesale rebuild — image, slot
table, packer cursor, and live count are all reset — triggered when the hash
load crosses 75 % **or** the packer reports the texture is full. The next draw
re-rasterises the visible page lazily into the fresh atlas, so the cost is
bounded by the page size, not session history. The check is a single comparison
at the top of every `panel_render()`, behind a device-idle fence so tearing the
in-use image down is safe ([ADR-0020](../adr/0020-atlas-reclamation-and-glyph-layer-modularization.md),
superseding [ADR-0019](../adr/0019-atlas-hash-compaction.md)).

Without it the texture filled and new glyphs rendered blank permanently — the
original "panel goes stale after a while" bug.

## Swapchain Management

### Grow-only, size-quantised

The popup width varies with candidate string length. Previously, every width
change rebuilt the swapchain (`vkDeviceWaitIdle` + WSI roundtrips), stalling
the single-threaded IME loop.

The fix: buffer sizes are quantised to 64 px and **grow only**. Shrinks and
sub-quantum widenings reuse the existing swapchain. `wp_viewport_set_source`
crops the oversized buffer to the exact content rect. After a short warm-up
(the widest candidate row seen), `flux_surface_resize` is never called again
during steady-state paging
([ADR-0013](../adr/0013-grow-only-popup-swapchain.md)).

### Non-blocking present mode

The popup is an on-demand surface — it commits a frame only when content
changes. Under FIFO (vsync), `vkQueuePresentKHR` blocks until the compositor
releases a buffer, but the compositor has no reason to release buffers promptly
for a surface it is not scheduling frames for. Profiling showed ~86 % of
wall-clock time in `vkQueuePresentKHR`.

The swapchain is created with `vsync = false`. flux selects `MAILBOX`, then
`IMMEDIATE`, then falls back to `FIFO`. Non-blocking present returns without
waiting on buffer release
([ADR-0010](../adr/0010-non-blocking-candidate-popup-present.md)).

### Bounded acquire

After screen lock, DPMS-off, or suspend, the compositor stops releasing
swapchain images. `flux_surface_begin_frame` is called with a bounded timeout
(~32 ms, two vblanks at 60 Hz). On timeout the frame is skipped and retried;
after consecutive timeouts the swapchain is recreated
([ADR-0006](../adr/0006-resilient-candidate-popup-present.md)).

The two protections are complementary:

| Concern | Protection |
|---------|------------|
| Acquire stall after lock/suspend | Bounded timeout + recover streak (ADR-0006) |
| Steady-state present throttle | Non-blocking present mode (ADR-0010) |
| Per-page swapchain rebuild | Grow-only quantised buffers (ADR-0013) |

## Font Cache Management

Over long sessions, Fontconfig's internal caches grow unbounded (repeated
`FcInit()` without `FcFini()`). The host exports
`typio_flux_engine_purge_font_caches()` and calls it on every config reload,
clearing the font-object cache, font-file cache, fallback-font cache, and
Fontconfig internals. This bounds memory without requiring a daemon restart
([ADR-0009](../adr/0009-long-term-performance-optimizations.md)).

## Event-Loop Integration

All rendering runs synchronously on the single-threaded IME event loop
([ADR-0004](../adr/0004-event-loop-scheduling-and-watchdog.md)). There is no
dedicated render thread. Input callbacks set `popup_update_pending`; the render
is flushed once per loop iteration in the `POPUP_UPDATE` watchdog stage. This
design avoids cross-thread Wayland/flux state access and protocol-sequencing
risk.

A consequence of this architecture: a frozen panel never corrupts committed
text. Key events queue on the Wayland fd and are processed in order regardless
of what the renderer is doing. The visible highlight may lag, but the committed
selection stays correct.

## Performance Summary

The optimizations form a layered defence against IME-specific stuttering
patterns. Each addresses a distinct measured cause:

| Layer | Problem | Fix | ADR |
|-------|---------|-----|-----|
| Text shaping | Per-text-run synchronous texture upload | Shared R8 glyph atlas, upload once | 0012 |
| Text colour | Per-colour glyph duplication | Coverage + draw-time tint | 0011 |
| Atlas reclaim | Texture saturates / hash table degrades over a session | Wholesale rebuild on packer exhaustion or 75 % load | 0020 |
| Fallback fonts | `FcFontSort` re-run per layout under LRU churn | Per-codepoint resolution memo | 0020 |
| Swapchain | `vkDeviceWaitIdle` on every width change | Grow-only quantised buffers | 0013 |
| Present | FIFO blocks on compositor buffer release | Non-blocking present (MAILBOX) | 0010 |
| Acquire | Compositor holds all images after resume | Bounded timeout + swapchain recovery | 0006 |
| Fonts | Fontconfig unbounded cache growth | Purge on config reload | 0009 |
| Snapshot | Full deep-copy on selection-only changes | Content-equality fast-path | 0009 |
