/**
 * @file font_cache.h
 * @brief Cache of opened font objects (FT_Face + hb_font_t), keyed by
 *        (path, size, weight).
 *
 * A font object must outlive every TypioTextShape and every glyph-atlas entry
 * that references it: shapes hold a borrowed FT_Face* and the atlas is keyed by
 * font_id and re-rasterises on miss. Distinct (path, size, weight) tuples are a
 * bounded resource in practice (a handful of system fonts × a few sizes × a few
 * weights), so the cache GROWS on demand and never frees a face at runtime —
 * entries are released only by font_cache_clear() at teardown / reload.
 *
 *   Bound:   unbounded but naturally small (system fonts × sizes × weights).
 *   Evict:   none — faces are borrowed by live shapes; freeing one mid-session
 *            is a use-after-free.
 *   Reclaim: font_cache_clear() at teardown / config reload only.
 *   Observe: font_id values are monotonic; the atlas keys on them.
