/**
 * @file text_shaper.h
 * @brief Text shaper: turns a string + font into a colour-independent shape.
 *
 * The shaper (FreeType + HarfBuzz) produces a TypioTextShape — a glyph run
 * plus a colour-independent R8 coverage mask in the shared glyph atlas. Colour
 * is applied at draw time as a tint (see typio_text_shape_fill), so a shape is
 * neither tied to a colour nor part of its LRU cache identity.
 *
 * libtypio used to ship `typio/abi/renderer.h` so any host could plug a shaper
 * (cairo/skia/flux) into the panel composer. After the orphan-renderer cleanup
 * these types are no longer part of libtypio's public ABI and live here,
 * alongside the only host that uses them.
