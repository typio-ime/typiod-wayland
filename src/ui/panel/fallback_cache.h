/*
 * Coverage-keyed LRU cache for fallback-font resolution.
 *
 * Resolving a fallback font (FcFontSort over the whole system font set plus a
 * per-codepoint coverage scan) is expensive and runs synchronously on the IME
 * event loop, ahead of the panel present. CJK input produces an unbounded
 * stream of distinct candidate strings, so a cache keyed on the text itself
 * collapses to a ~0% hit rate and re-runs the resolve on every keystroke.
 *
 * This cache keys on *coverage* instead: each resolved font remembers the
 * FcCharSet it covers, and a later text reuses it whenever the text's
 * codepoints are a subset of that coverage (FcCharSetIsSubset). One Noto CJK
 * face then satisfies every later phrase, so the resolve runs ~once per script
 * regardless of how many distinct phrases have been typed. Eviction is true
 * LRU, so the hit rate does not degrade as the cache fills.
