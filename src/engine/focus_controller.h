/**
 * @file focus_controller.h
 * @brief Desired-vs-actual focus lifecycle controller.
 *
 * There is no stored lifecycle phase. The only persisted things are raw input
 * facts and live resource handles. Every event-loop tick runs one step:
 *
 *   facts   = record(inputs)
 *   desired = reduce(facts, prev)   pure
 *   actual  = observe(resources)    live snapshot
 *   effects = diff(desired, actual) pure, minimal, idempotent
 *   apply(effects)                  effectful
 *
 * This module owns the pure half: facts, desired, actual, effects, reduce,
 * and diff. The effectful half (observe + apply) lives in
 * src/wayland/focus_effects.c because it must read and mutate the
 * TypioWlFrontend struct.
 *
 * @see docs/explanation/focus-controller.md
